I added four buttons and a noew style class for those buttons.
the buttons were: square root, Pi, natural log, and Round
to integrate these buttons I had add a sixth row so all of the buttons were equaly formatted and I had to add to the java script to make them work proporly.
here is a gif of the calculator working with the new buttons
